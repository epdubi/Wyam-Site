I'm Eric, and I have a thing for all things web. More specifically I'm a Software Developer working primarily within the .NET ecosystem. Professionally I have experience with .NET and elm-lang. When I'm not working on Software, you will find me spending time with my family, gaming, or hiking with my girlfriend and our pups (Millie, and Nyko).
